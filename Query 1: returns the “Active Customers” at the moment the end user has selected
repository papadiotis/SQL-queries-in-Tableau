##  Suppose that you have a dataset from a company that sells cars or antiques or air conditions.
##  This example is valid whenever we encounter a product that is being sold and probably disposed by the same company.

##  Variable vocabulary
##• PurchaseDate is the date that the product has been purchased.
##  It is a date that we know with absolute certainty because our company sold this product.
##• DisposalDate is the date that the product has been disposed. If we know the DisposalDate, then fine.
##  But we can never be sure if the client has decided to dispose the product using a service which we are unable to track. 
##  That fact creates a fundamental problem. As the time progresses clients who disposed our products without our knowledge
##  are stacking up. 
##• Parameters.CutOff is a Tableau parameter that is partially solving the problem described above. 
##  It cuts off all the observations which are older than its value. The end user is responsible to determine the CutOff value.
##• Parameters.DateFilter is a Tableau parameter that gives the end user the ability to navigate though the time.
##  (The name of this parameter inside Tableau is DateFilter, but when you write the SQL query you have to add the “Parameters.~~~ ”.)

## Care!!!!!!!!!! Tableau is putting spaces in the variable names in order to "make them easy for humans to read".
## ALWAYS SPELL THE VARIABLE NAMES AS THEY ARE BEING SPELLED IN YOUR RAW DATA

##Query 1: returns the “Active Customers” at the moment the end user has selected.
SELECT *
FROM OurDatabase
WHERE	(
         PurchaseDate <= <Parameters.DateFilter>
                  AND
        			(
                           DisposalDate >= <Parameters.DateFilter>
           			 OR
      			DisposalDate    IS NULL 
                           ## we are keeping these values, because if for example we are looking at the 
                           ## present day and yesterday a new purchase occurred the disposal date is  
                           ## going to be null and the customer active.
                           )
         )
 
         AND NOT
           	(
           	[PurchaseDate] < DATEADD(Year, -<Parameters.CutOff>, <Parameters.DateFilter>)
                           AND
            	[DisposalDate] IS NULL 
                  ## we want to keep the observations where disposal date IS NOT NULL because all  
                  ## of these observations do not fall under the DisposalDate problem
                  )
## END
