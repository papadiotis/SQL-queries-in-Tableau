##Suppose that you have a dataset from a company that sells cars or antiques watches or air conditions.
##These examples are valid whenever we encounter a product that is being sold, serviced and probably disposed from the same company.

##  Variable vocabulary
##•	PurchaseDate is the date that the product is being purchased.
##  It is a date that we know with absolute certainty because our company sold this product.
##•	DisposalDate is the date that the product is being disposed. If we know the DisposalDate, then fine.
##  But we can never be sure if the client has decided to dispose the product using a service which we are unable to track. 
##  That fact creates a fundamental problem. As the time progresses clients who disposed our products without our knowledge
##  are staking up. 
##•	Parameters.CutOff is a Tableau parameter that is partially solving the problem described above. 
##  It literally cuts off all the observations which are older than its value. The end user is responsible to determine the CutOff value.
##•	Parameters.DateFilter is a Tableau parameter that gives to the end user the ability to navigate though the time.
##  (The name of this parameter inside Tableau is DateFilter, but when you wright the SQL query you have to add the “Parameters.~~~ ”.)

##Query 1: returns the “Active Customers” at the moment the end user has selected.
SELECT *
FROM OurDatabase
WHERE	(
PurchaseDate <= <Parameters.DateFilter>
         		AND
        			(
DisposalDate >= <Parameters.DateFilter>
           			 OR
      			DisposalDate    IS NULL ## we are keeping these values, because if we are looking at the 
                                    ##present and  yesterday a new purchase occurred the disposal date is  
                                    ##going to be null and the customer active.

           		(

            		AND
            		[DisposalDate] IS NULL ## we want to keep the observations where disposal date IS NOT NULL because all  
                                       ##of these observations are valid
