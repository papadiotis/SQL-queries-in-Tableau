##  Suppose that you have a dataset from a company that sells cars or antiques or air conditions.
##  This example is valid whenever we encounter a product that is being sold and probably disposed by the same company.

##  Variable vocabulary
##• Transaction Date And Time is the exact time of the Transaction. it might be a purchase, a service etc.
##• Parameters.DateFilter is a Tableau parameter that gives the end user the ability to navigate though the time.
##  (The name of this parameter inside Tableau is DateFilter, but when you write the SQL query you have to add the “Parameters.~~~ ”.)

## Care!!!!!!!!!! Tableau is putting spaces in the variable names in order to "make them easy for humans to read".
## ALWAYS SPELL THE VARIABLE NAMES AS THEY ARE BEING SPELLED IN YOUR RAW DATA

## Query 2: Selecting Variables from a Database

SELECT
      OurDatabase.Product,
      Max(OurDatabase.TransactionDateAndTime) AS LastTransaction,
      Count(OurDatabase.TransactionDateAndTime) AS TotalNumberOfTransactions

FROM OurDatabase

GROUP BY OurDatabase.Product

HAVING (((Max(OurDatabase.TransactionDateAndTime))<=<Parameters.DateFilter>))
## END
