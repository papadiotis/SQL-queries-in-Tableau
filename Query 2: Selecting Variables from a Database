##Suppose that you have a dataset from a company that sells cars or antiques watches or air conditions.
##These examples are valid whenever we encounter a product that is being sold, serviced and probably disposed from the same company.

##  Variable vocabulary
##•	Transaction Date And Time is the exact time of the Transaction. it might be a purchase, a service etc.
##•	Parameters.DateFilter is a Tableau parameter that gives to the end user the ability to navigate though the time.
##  (The name of this parameter inside Tableau is DateFilter, but when you wright the SQL query you have to add the “Parameters.~~~ ”.)

## Care!!!!!!!!!! Tableau is putting spaces in the variable names in order to make them easy for humans to read.
## ALWAYS SPELL THE VARIABLE NAMES AS THEY ARE BEING SPELLED IN YOUR ROW DATA

##Query 2: Selecting Variables from a Database

SELECT
      OurDatabase.Product,
      Max(OurDatabase.TransactionDateAndTime) AS LastTransaction,
      Count(OurDatabase.TransactionDateAndTime) AS TotalNumberOfTransactions

FROM OurDatabase

GROUP BY OurDatabase.Product

HAVING (((Max(OurDatabase.TransactionDateAndTime))<=<Parameters.DateFilter>))
